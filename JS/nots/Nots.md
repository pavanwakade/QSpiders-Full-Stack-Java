## History of JavaScript  (**3-2-25**)
- **1995**: JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** while working at **Netscape Corporation**.  
  - Initially called **Mocha**, then renamed **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript** in the same year.  
- **1997**: JavaScript was handed over to **ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)** for standardization.  
  - ECMA released the first official specification, **ECMAScript (ES1)**, in 1997.  
  - ECMA is a **non-profit organization** responsible for maintaining and evolving the **ECMAScript standard**.  

## JavaScript Features  
- **High-Level**: portability,readabilitya,writyabiloty,Simplifies low-level operations for ease of use.  
- **Object-Oriented & Object-Based**: Supports **prototype-based inheritance**.  
- **Single-Threaded**: Executes one Task(operation) at a time.  
- **Synchronous (by default)**: Executes code sequentially.  
- **Interpreted & Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiled**:  
  - Initially, JavaScript was interpreted.  
  - Modern JavaScript engines use **JIT compilation** for better performance.  

## Additional Concepts  
- **Readability & Writability**:  
  - JavaScript is easy to **read, write, and understand**.  
  - This makes it easier to **find and fix errors** efficiently.  
- **Platform Independence**:  
  - JavaScript code can **run on any platform** (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) with a browser or runtime like Node.js.  
- **Productivity**:  
  - JavaScript is **highly productive** due to its vast ecosystem of **libraries and frameworks**.  
  - Developers can write code faster using tools like **React, Angular, Vue, and Express.js**.  
  
## What is AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- After parsing the code, it is converted into an **AST**.  
- The AST breaks the code into small parts to identify **syntactical errors and mistakes** efficiently.

## Script Tag
- Used to write **JavaScript** code in an HTML file.

## NoScript
- If the JavaScript engine is disabled, the **NoScript** tag can be used to display alternative content.

## Ways to Add JavaScript
1. **Internal** - Write JavaScript code inside the **script** tag within an HTML file.

2. **External** - Create a separate file with a **.js** extension and link it to the HTML file using the **script** tag.

## Tokens
- Tokens are the smallest unit of a programming language.(;,...)

### Types of Tokens
1. **Keywords** - Reserved words or pre defined words recognized by the JavaScript engine (e.g., `let`, `var`, `const`, `function`).

2. **Identifiers** - Names given by the programmer to JavaScript members like variables, objects, and functions.

3. **Literals** - Fixed values or data in JavaScript.
   - **Primitive Literals**: Numbers, Booleans, Undefined, Null, Strings, NaN, Symbols.
   - **Non-Primitive Literals**: Objects, Arrays, Functions.

4. **Operators** - Symbols that perform operations on operands (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

5. **Separators** - Symbols used to separate code elements (e.g., `{}`, `()`, `,`, `;`).

6. **Comments** - Used to add explanations or disable code execution (e.g., `// single-line`, `/* multi-line */`).

7. **Punctuators** - Symbols that define structure (e.g., `[]`, `{}`, `()`).

## JavaScript Data Types  
JavaScript has **two main categories** of data types:  

### 🔹 **1. Primitive Data Types** (Immutable, Stored by Value)  
1. **Number** – Integers & Floating-point values  
2. **String** – Textual data  
3. **Boolean** – `true` or `false`  
4. **Undefined** – Variable declared but not assigned  
5. **Null** – Represents an empty or unknown value  
6. **Symbol (ES6)** – Unique identifier  
7. **BigInt (ES11)** – Large integers beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`  

### 🔹 **2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types** (Mutable, Stored by Reference)  
8. **Object** – Key-value pairs  
9. **Array** – Ordered collection of values  
10. **Function** – Block of reusable code  
11. **Date** – Represents date & time  
12. **RegExp** – Regular expressions for pattern matching
