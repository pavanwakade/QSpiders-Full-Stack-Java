## History of JavaScript  
- **1995**: JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** while working at **Netscape Corporation**.  
  - Initially, it was called **Mocha**, then renamed **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript** in the same year.  
- **1997**: JavaScript was handed over to **ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)** for standardization.  
  - ECMA released the first official specification, **ECMAScript (ES1)**, in 1997.  
  - ECMA is a **non-profit organization** responsible for maintaining and evolving the **ECMAScript standard**.  

## JavaScript Features  
- **High-Level**: Abstracts low-level details for ease of use.  
- **Object-Oriented & Object-Based**: Supports **prototype-based inheritance**.  
- **Single-Threaded**: Executes one operation at a time.  
- **Synchronous (by default)**: Executes code sequentially.  
- **Interpreted & Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiled**:  
  - Initially, JavaScript was interpreted.  
  - Modern JavaScript engines use **JIT compilation** for better performance.  

## Additional Concepts  
- **Readability & Writability**:  
  - JavaScript is easy to **read, write, and understand**.  
  - This makes it easier to **find and fix errors** efficiently.  
- **Platform Independence**:  
  - JavaScript code can **run on any platform** (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) with a browser or runtime like Node.js.  
- **Productivity**:  
  - JavaScript is **highly productive** due to its vast ecosystem of **libraries and frameworks**.  
  - Developers can write code faster using tools like **React, Angular, Vue, and Express.js**.
